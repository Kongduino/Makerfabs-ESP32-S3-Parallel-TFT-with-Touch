# Makerfabs ESP32-S3 Parallel TFT with Touch
## Introduction

The 3.5" 320x480 TFT LCD driver is an ILI9488. It uses a 16-bit parallel line for communication with ESP32-S3. The main clock can be set up to 20 MHz, making the display smooth enough for videos. You can freely use some of the Mabee pins (I2c and IOs) with the breakout connectors, to connect the ESP32-S3 display with sensors / actuators, suitable for IoT applications.

# Code

## Compiler Options

- Install board: ESP32
- Install library: [LovyanGFX library](https://github.com/lovyan03/LovyanGFX). 
- Edit the code based on the touch screen. If you use a resistive screen (which is the case here), choose NS2009_TOUCH. If you use a capacitive screen, choose FT6236_TOUCH.
- Use a type-C use cable to connect USB-TTL to PC.
- To compile and upload code, select "ESP32-S3 DEV Module" and "UART0".

## Firmware

### SD16_3.5

Factory firmware. First it runs the boot self-test to check the hardware. Press down in the middle of the touch screen as prompted to display a picture on the SD card, MakerFabs' logo. Finally, it prints the touch coordinates on the serial port.
